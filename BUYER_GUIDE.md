Welcome to HairBuySell! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to find the best vendors, source high-quality hair, and manage your purchasing process efficiently.

## 1. Getting Started: Your Professional Profile

Your profile helps vendors understand your business and sourcing needs.

### Step 1: Register Your Account
- Navigate to the **Register** page and select "I am a Buyer."
- Fill out your details, including your name, company name (optional), email, and location.
- Your **bio** is important! Use it to tell vendors about your business (e.g., "I own a salon in New York specializing in custom wigs") and the types of hair you typically look for. This helps vendors provide more accurate quotes.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Profile
- Once registered, go to your **Dashboard**.
- In the "Profile Settings" tab, you can:
    - **Upload an Avatar:** Use a professional logo for your salon or a photo of yourself.
    - **Update Your Details:** Fill out the "Business Details" section, including your business type and years in business. This adds to your credibility.

## 3. How to Request a Quote

You have two powerful ways to get quotes on HairBuySell.

### Option 1: Requesting a Quote for a Specific Product
1.  Find a product you are interested in.
2.  On the product detail page, click the **"Request a Quote"** button.
3.  You will be taken to a form with the product's details pre-filled.
4.  Fill in your name, email, the **quantity** you need, and any additional details (e.g., "Do you offer this in a lighter color?").
5.  Submit the form. Your request will be sent directly to that vendor.

### Option 2: Submitting a General Inquiry to the Marketplace
Use this when you can't find exactly what you're looking for and want vendors to come to you.
1.  Click **"Request a Quote"** from the main site navigation.
2.  The form will be blank. Fill in all the details of the hair you are looking for (hair type, length, color, texture, quantity).
3.  Be as specific as possible in the "Additional Details" section.
4.  Submit the form. Your request will be posted to our **Sourcing Marketplace**, where all of our Verified Sellers can see it and contact you if they have a match.

## 4. Becoming a Verified Buyer ($5/month)

While optional, verification is a powerful tool for serious buyers.

### Benefits of Verification
- **Verified Badge:** A blue checkmark on your profile signals to vendors that you are a serious, established business, not just a casual browser.
- **Build Trust:** Vendors are more likely to respond quickly and favorably to requests from verified buyers.
- **Better Responses:** Stand out from the crowd and get prioritized attention from top sellers.

### How to Get Verified
1.  From your Dashboard, click on the **"Billing"** tab or the "Get Verified Now" prompt.
2.  Review the benefits and click **"Proceed to Payment"** to be redirected to our secure payment partner, Stripe.
3.  Once complete, your "Verified Buyer" badge will be activated.

- **Saved Vendors:** A quick-access list of all your preferred vendors.
- **Profile Settings:** Update your public profile and contact information at any time.
